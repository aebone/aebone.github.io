<center>I am a software developer passionate about front-end and mobile development. Since 2012 I work with HTML, CSS, Javascript and web frameworks, especially Ruby on Rails. In 2015, I was a scholarship holder and research assistant at DePaul University in Chicago, working with mobile development tools, primarily Xamarin and native Android. At this point, I started to get interested in the mobile development world, including Ionic Framework and native iOS.</center>
