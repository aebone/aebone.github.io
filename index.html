  <p>Hi. My name is Aline. I have one <em>cat son</em> called <span class="hover">Carlos<img class="carlos" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alinebone/carlos-photos/main/images/carlos92.jpg" alt="Picture of Carlos"></span>. I like technology, 80's things in general (art, music, architecture, ...), retrowave/synthwave/cyberpunk music/art. As far as possible I help local shelters 🐱🐶. I get along with pets but I'm starting to like people too.</p>
