  Quoting my friend: <q>I build it and I break it. Then I get pissed off and start again from scratch.</q>
  <p>This is the 657434th version of my blog, and as I'm trying to be a minimalist (and failing), the most minimalist one.</p>
  <p>Apart from technology I like 80's things in general (art, music, architecture), retrowave/synthwave music, cyberpunk art, and cats. By the way, if you're reading this, help your local shelters. 🐱🐶</p>
